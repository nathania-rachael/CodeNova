# CodeNova


## Overview
**CodeNova** is an AI-powered code assistant designed to streamline software development by automating code generation, debugging, documentation, and code explanations. It integrates multiple AI models to provide a seamless and intelligent coding experience.integrating IBM's Granite LLMs to enhance software development workflows. This project was built for the **Generative AI Hackathon with IBM GRANITE** and provides business-valued solutions by automating various software engineering tasks.

To access CodeNova through streamlit click [CodeNova](https://codenova.streamlit.app/) (open in dark mode for better user experience)
## Features
The application includes six main tools:
1. **Code Wizard** - Automatically generate code based on user input prompt.
2. **Fix-it** - Identify and fix issues in the provided code.
3. **Code Whisperer** - Provide detailed text & voice-based explanations of code functionality.
4. **Code Optimizer** - Improve code structure and efficiency.
5. **DocuBot** - Generate structured documentation in TXT, PDF and DOCX formats.
6. **AI Pair Coder** - Assist developers in real-time coding collaborations.

## Technology Used
CodeNova leverages IBM Granite AI models for core functionalities, ensuring high-performance AI-driven code assistance. Specific features are powered by industry-leading AI services:

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** - Used for Front-End UI and deployment
- **IBM Granite-34B-Code-Instruct:** – Used for code generation, debugging, optimization, and pair programming.
- **IBM Granite-20B-Code-Instruct:** - Powers text-based code explanations.
- **Google Gemini Pro** – Enables comprehensive document generation to streamline documentation tasks.
- **Google Text-to-Speech** – Provides text and voice-based code explanations, enhancing developer understanding.

## Installation and Setup (For running it locally)
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nathania-rachael/CodeNova.git
   cd CodeNova
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set Up API Keys:
   CodeNova uses IBM Granite, Google Gemini Pro, and Google Text-to-Speech. Ensure you have the necessary API keys configured in a `.env` file.

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```sh
   touch .env
   ```
   - Add your API keys:
   ```sh
   IBM_API_KEY="your-ibm-api-key"
   GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
   ```
5. In `config.py`, replace `Gemini_API_key=st.secrets["GEMINI_API_KEY"]` and `API_KEY = os.getenv("IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY")` with direct retrieval from `.env` file by doing the below.
   ```sh
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   
   # Load environment variables from .env file
   load_dotenv()

   #Retrieve API Keys from .env file
   Gemini_API_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
   API_KEY = os.getenv("IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY")
   ```
6. In `tts_helper.py` replace lines 9-19 with the following.
   ```sh
   os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "{Enter file path for Google Text-to-Speech API JSON file}"
   ```
7. Run the Application:
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## How to Use
1. Navigate through the sidebar to select a tool.
2. Input your code or query and click 'Generate'.
3. View, copy, or download the output.
4. Use the documentation generator for structured reports.

## Business Value
